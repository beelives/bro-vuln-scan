Zeek (Bro) Vulnerability Scan Detector
======================================

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/fkmclane/bro-vuln-scan.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fkmclane/bro-vuln-scan)

A vulnerability scan detection script for Zeek (Bro). This script simply detects the difference between a basic scan and a vulnerability scan by whether a reasonable amount of data was transferred on a few ports or many hosts in a short period of time.

Many thanks to ncsa/bro-simple-scan on which this script is based.


Usage
-----

```sh
$ bro-pkg install https://github.com/fkmclane/bro-vuln-scan.git
```
