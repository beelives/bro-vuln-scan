Bro Vulnerability Scan Detector
===============================

A vulnerability scan detection script for Bro. This script simply detects the difference between a basic scan and a vulnerability scan by whether a reasonable amount of data was transferred on a few ports or many hosts in a short period of time.

Many thanks to ncsa/bro-simple-scan on which this script is based.


Usage
-----

```sh
$ bro-pkg install https://github.com/fkmclane/bro-vuln-scan.git
